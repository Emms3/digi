#Hello there,
This project is built for my friends' final year project.
##What does it do?
It takes input data from sensors that are planted in a "smart green house" and it translates it to actual data.
##For example:
_____________________________________
  input  | AADAAA==
  output | a string dataType
_____________________________________

Once this application has been completed. This page should be updated.
